# iOSYotoLiteMVP (skeleton)

This folder is a skeleton for the iOS companion app implementing CoreNFC read/write and AVPlayer playback.

Structure:
- `iOSYotoLiteMVP.xcodeproj` (not included)
- `Sources/` - Swift source files

Notes:
- Use Xcode 13+ and Swift 5.7+
- CoreNFC requires a physical device (NFC not available on Simulator)
- Add Firebase configuration if cloud sync is desired (GoogleService-Info.plist)

Example Swift files are in `Sources/` for guidance.
