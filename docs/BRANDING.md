# Branding & Naming

- App name: JoshTap (display name may vary per build flavor)
- Repository / product: JoshTapApp
- Package name: `com.parris.joshtap`
- Canonical public URL for NFC tokens: `https://joshtap.app/t/<token>`

Guidelines
- Use `JoshTap`, `JoshTapApp`, or `joshtap.app` only. Do not reintroduce legacy `yoto` or `yotolite` strings in tracked files.
- Keep tokens URL-safe and 10–16 chars (lowercase).

Screenshots
- Name screenshot files clearly: `screenshots/library.png`, `screenshots/cards.png`, `screenshots/play.png`, `screenshots/nfc_write.png`.
